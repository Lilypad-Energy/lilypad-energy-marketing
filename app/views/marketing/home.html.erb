              <p class="text-center">Modern America understands our grid to be a one-way street: power goes
                  to a home, gets used and gets paid off on your utility bills. Lilypad enables
                  money to flow in both directions by letting users work with the grid to
                  help balance load.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center">Rebalancing</h3>
              <p class="text-center">The grid has a finite amount of power and can reach capacity at times.
                  This is where you come in. Whether you have a backup power cell, a set
                  of solar panels, or you&apos;re okay turning off your AC for an hour, Lilypad
                  lets you know when you can help the grid and make money doing it.</p>

              <p class="text-center">All you have to do is find and select the partner program(s) you wouldlike to enroll in. Lilypad takes care of the rest, ultimately sending you, the homeowner, checks for your help supporting the grid.</p>
